        Thanks for using the <strong>pencil.domains </strong>services (including its website, and mobile and web-based
        applications, and any other tools, products, or services provided by Pencil Works, LLC that link to or reference
        these Terms) (collectively, the “Services”). The Services are provided by <strong>Pencil Works, LLC</strong>
        (“Pencil Works”, “we,” “our,” or “us”), located at <strong>P.O. Box Sunset Lk Road, Suit B-2 Newark, DE
          19702</strong>, U.S.A.
        By using our Services, you are agreeing to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). Please read them carefully. Our
        Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements)
        may apply. If additional terms or conditions are available with or applicable to the relevant Services, then
        those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. By accessing or using
        the Services, you intend and agree to be legally bound by these Terms. You may wish to print or save a local
        copy of the Terms for your records.
        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY AND THAT YOU ARE RELEASING US FROM
        VARIOUS CLAIMS IN SECTION 13 BELOW. THESE TERMS ALSO CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 18 THAT
        AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES.

          <li><strong> Renting Domains</strong></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        Our Services enable you to register certain second level domains on the decentralized, permissionless,
        blockchain-based naming protocol further described at handshake.org and hns-dev.org (the “Handshake Protocol”,
        and each such top-level domain on the Handshake Protocol, a “Handshake TLD”).
        As part of the registration process for second level domains on Handshake TLDs, we may require you to provide
        (and timely update in the event of any change) certain information required by us or the Handshake Protocol in
        order to register or maintain your second level domain (“Registration Information”). You agree that all
        Registration Information you provide to us will be accurate, complete, and timely updated in the event of any
        change.
        We reserve the right to list, not list, or withdraw Handshake top level domains ("TLDs") that are available for
        rent via the Services our sole discretion. You acknowledge that Handshake TLDs may have unique eligibility
        requirements. Accordingly, before you rent any second level domain on a Handshake TLD, you should review the
        Handshake Protocol or other registry rules, policies, and agreements for the Handshake TLD in question to ensure
        that you can comply with all eligibility requirements and will be able to register the domain upon a successful
        rent.
        You agree that we, in our sole discretion and without liability to you, may refuse to accept the registration of
        any domain to you. In addition, we cannot and do not check to see whether any domain you select, or the use you
        make of any domain, or any other use of the Services, violates the legal rights of others. It is your sole
        responsibility to know whether or not any domain you select or use violates the legal rights of others. We may
        be ordered by a court to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain; it is your responsibility to list accurate
        Registration Information in association with your account and to communicate with litigants, potential
        litigants, and governmental authorities. It is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other
        communications to you.
        You agree to be bound by the appropriate domain dispute resolution policy prescribed by the Handshake TLD
        registry, if any. We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, choose to assist you in facilitating the
        resolution of any disputes between you and a third party regarding your domain, provided, however, that we have
        no obligation to do so, and we do not assume any responsibility or liability as a result of offering such
        assistance to you.
        You understand and acknowledge that, in some cases, you may be unable to transfer a domain to another registrar
        or other third party for up to sixty (60) days after you rent the domain, or a different amount of time
        established by the Handshake TLD registry. This restriction helps us avoid domain theft.
        After you rent a Domain, it becomes a “Parked Domain,” as used elsewhere in these Terms.
        We are not an auctioneer or an escrow agent. Although we may temporarily take possession of a domain to
        facilitate its auction, we do not perform any diligence or make any representations or warranties regarding
        these domain names. We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the domain names listed within
        our Services.

        We may also place advertisements on, and collect revenue from, your Parked Domains while they are parked with
        us, and we will retain all revenue from such activity. You authorize us to do so without any further obligation
        to you.
        If the change of ownership in the Parked Domain is not completed for any reason, including but not limited to,
        due to either party’s fraudulent activity, you acknowledge and agree that we have no liability or responsibility
        regarding the same. In all cases, we do not make any representations or warranties regarding the change of
        ownership of the Parked Domain, and we expressly disclaim all liability or responsibility regarding the same.
        The Services also enable you to link to Escrow.com, which you can use to sell your Parked Domain. All sales of
        Parked Domains are subject to Escrow.com’s Terms of Use, and we expressly disclaim all liability or
        responsibility regarding the sale of a Parked Domain through Escrow.com. You can read Escrow.com’s Terms of Use

        You are solely responsible for ensuring that any and all domains are renewed prior to their expiration, should
        you so desire their renewal. You may renew your domain at any time before the expiration date. We shall have no
        liability to you or any third party in connection with the renewal, including, but not limited to, any failure

        days prior to the renewal date. In the absence of such notification from you, we will automatically renew, for a

        we are not obligated to do so.
        In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and

        process your opt-out. Please also be aware that opting out of service announcements and administrative messages
        may cause you to miss important messages about your Parked Domains, like renewal notices.
        Some of our Services are available on mobile devices or may utilize SMS/iMessage, which may cause you to incur

        limiting anything else in this section, interest will also be charged on all unpaid delinquent amounts at the
        rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lesser. You agree to
        reimburse us for all collection agency fees, attorneys’ fees and other costs we may incur to collect delinquent
        amounts you owe to us.

        Please also note that the information provided in a notice of copyright infringement may be forwarded to the

        <ul>
          <li>The specific URLs of material that we have removed or to which we have disabled access.</li>

        Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, we will forward it to Notifying Party who submitted the original

          <li><strong> About these Terms</strong></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        We may modify these Terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service for any reason, for example, to
        reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the Terms regularly and the “Last
        Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. We’ll use reasonable efforts to give you notice of these
        modifications, such as posting notice of modifications to these Terms on this web page, through the Services, or
        via email. By continuing to use the Services after we make these modifications, you agree that you will be
        subject to the modified Terms. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue
        your use of that Service.
        If there is a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms for a Service, the additional terms will
        control for that conflict.
        These Terms control the relationship between Pencil Works and you. They do not create any third-party
        beneficiary rights (except in the limited case of Section 17). If you do not comply with these Terms, and we
        don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as
        taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect
        any other terms.
        The laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, excluding Pennsylvania’s conflict of laws
        rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.
        You may not assign or delegate your rights or obligations relating to these terms or your account for the
        Services without our prior written consent. We may assign these terms or assign or delegate any of our rights or
        obligations at any time.

          <li><strong> Binding Arbitration</strong></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        Without limiting your waiver in Section 13, you agree to the following:
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Purpose.</strong> Any and all Disputes (as defined below) involving you and Pencil Works will be
            resolved through individual arbitration. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less
            discovery and appellate review than in court. This Section 18 (the "Arbitration Provision") shall be broadly
            interpreted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, this Section 18 does not apply to an
            action by either party to enjoin the infringement or misuse of its intellectual property rights, including
            copyright, trademark, patent, or trade secret rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Definitions</strong>. The term "Dispute" means any claim or controversy related to the Services or
            the Software, including but not limited to any and all: (1) claims for relief and theories of liability,
            whether based in contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (2) claims
            that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement; (3) claims that arise after the expiration or
            termination of these Terms; and (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action
            litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. As used in this Arbitration Provision,
            "Pencil Works" means Pencil Works LLC and any of its predecessors, successors, assigns, parents,
            subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and
            agents, and “you” means you and any users or beneficiaries of your access to the Services or the Software.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.</strong> The party initiating the
            arbitration proceeding may open a case with JAMS, formerly Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services,
            Inc., (“JAMS”) by visiting its website (www.jamsadr.com) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-352-5267).
            You may deliver any required or desired notice to Pencil Works by mail to P.O. Box 15004 Philadelphia, PA
            19130.</li>
          <li><strong>Right to Sue in Small Claims Court.</strong> Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration
            Provision to the contrary, either you or Pencil Works may bring an individual action in a small claims court
            in the area where you access the Services if the claim is not aggregated with the claim of any other person
            and if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.</li>
          <li><strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> This Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal
            Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules
            and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect
            when you notify Pencil Works about your Dispute. You can obtain the JAMS Rules from the JAMS by visiting its
            website (www.jamsadr.com) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-352-5267). If there is a conflict between
            this Arbitration Provision and the rest of these Terms, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is
            a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the JAMS rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.
            If JAMS will not administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written, the parties shall
            agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually
            petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a
            proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written applying the JAMS Rules. A single arbitrator will
            resolve the Dispute. Unless you and Pencil Works agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in
            Philadelphia, PA . The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable
            steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The
            arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator’s essential findings and
            conclusions. The arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if
            necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator’s award. An arbitrator’s award that has been fully
            satisfied shall not be entered in any court.</li>
          <li><strong>Waiver of Class Actions and Collective Relief. </strong>THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR
            ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES
            INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A
            PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN
            FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY
            THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT
            OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</li>
          <li><strong>Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong>. If your claim seeks more than $75,000 in the aggregate, the
            payment of the JAMS’s fees and costs will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If your claims seek less than
            $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the JAMS’s fees and costs will be Pencil Works’s responsibility.
            However, if the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as
            measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the JAMS’s
            fees and costs shall be governed by the JAMS Rules and you shall reimburse Pencil Works for all fees and
            costs that were your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. You may hire an attorney to represent you in
            arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and additional costs and may only recover your
            attorneys’ fees and costs in the arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is
            decided in your favor. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, Pencil Works
            will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.</li>
          <li><strong>Severability and Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> If any part of subsection (f) of this Arbitration
            Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration provision will be unenforceable
            and the Dispute will be decided by a court. WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND Pencil Works AGREE
            TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW. If any other clause in this
            Arbitration Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this
            Arbitration Provision and the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be given full force and effect.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Continuation.</strong> This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination or expiration of
            these Terms.</li>
